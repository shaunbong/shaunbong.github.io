        <h1><strong>motivation</strong></h1>
        <p style="text-align: left;">I want to revolutionise the hiring process experience. Ultimately, the most important outcome
          is that candidates are matched with roles which can leverage their strengths. A
          large emphasis is placed on formal work experience and grades, but I do not believe a person’s
          calibre can be defined by those attributes alone. Our hobbies, our passions, the
          way we communicate are all facets which are suppressed and undervalued through
          our resumes but contribute heavily to who we are and what we stand for. I present
          this interactive resume as a compromise to showcase my experiences and values as an
          individual.</p>

          <dt>Fast Learner</dt>
          <dd>
            I have always believed I am a quick learner, but when asked during an interview I have trouble
            answering succinctly. What constitutes a fast learner? How does one prove they are a fast
            learner? As the old saying goes “actions speak louder than words.” The secondary motivation
            behind building this website was to prove to myself and others that I am indeed the swift
            learner I claim to be. Within the span of four days I was able to learn enough HTML, CSS and
            Bootstrap to develop the front-page static website which you are looking at right now with
            no previous experience in web development.

          <dt>Genuine</dt>
          <dd>
            Social constructs have manipulated us into believing there is a ‘right’ and ‘wrong’ way to act
            around others. The rise in social media has elevated this idea and further ingrained this
            misconception into our minds. Growing up in Australia, I have always seen the world quite
            differently from my peers, partially due to my background, and partially due to my quirky
            interests. I used to suppress those interests and replace them with ‘normal’ hobbies.
            Naturally, I became very self-aware and responsive to social queues. Over time, I started
            to challenge these social constructs, slowly breaking down the wall of illusions which were
            built upon bad experiences.
            Transparency and genuineness are virtues which are highly important to me and values
            which I will continue to practice in my future endeavours.
          </dd>
          <dt>Curiosity</dt>
          <dd>
            In search of my ‘passion’ I have picked up several hobbies along the way. This year alone I
            have picked up chess, reading, skateboarding and now web development. Although these
            hobbies are independent of my degree, there is something so alluring about learning a new
            skill. Each skill has given me a key takeaway and contributed uniquely towards my personal
            development. Curiosity and hunger for improvement have always been primary
            motivators behind my drive towards mastering a skill.

            <h4>Chess</h4>
            <p>
              I'm an avid chess player. This year I have played a little over 1,000 games. I enjoy it
              because it's purely strategic based. It's all about decision making and being adaptive to your
              opponent's intentions. Inherently it has taught me to not be so narrow minded and to view things
              from a wider perspective.

            <h4>Reading</h4>
            <p>
              I think reading is a hobby which everyone should pursue. I
              find it so valuable because it condenses years of knowledge into a single book.
              I enjoy reading about personal development. While reading does not make you directly
              smarter or wiser, it plants seeds of thoughts, which if watered consistently can
              grow to become healthy habits which contribute towards one's wellbeing.

            <h4>Skating</h4>
            <p>
                Initially the learning curve was steep for me. I could hardly stand on the board for more than 3 seconds. It was discouraging,
                but I stuck through it and within a couple weeks I was able to ride to uni without hesitation. Skating taught me that persistence
                is key and failure is temporary.
